Control-M is a powerful workload automation solution that allows organizations to automate the scheduling and processing of business workflows across various platforms and applications. Here are the key points about Control-M:

Automation and Scheduling:
Control-M enables you to automate the execution of processes (referred to as “jobs”) across different systems.
These jobs can be scripts, commands, or part of external applications.
You can define specific run information for each job, including scheduling criteria, dependencies, and post-processing actions.
Workflow Management:
Jobs often need to run at specific times or in a particular sequence. This flow of jobs is called a workflow.
Workflows can be complex, involving multiple interrelated jobs.
Control-M helps manage these workflows efficiently.
Folder Organization:
Jobs can be grouped into folders based on their functionality or related processing.
For example, you might have folders for different financial tasks (e.g., US finances, Australia finances) within an organization’s workflow.
Folders make it easier to understand the purpose of each job and how they work together.
Cross-Platform Support:
Control-M works seamlessly across various platforms, applications, data sources, and infrastructures.
You can integrate processes running on different systems into a single automated job flow.
Example Scenario:
Imagine a workflow that copies log files from a cloud environment, transfers them to a local data center using Managed File Transfer, converts them into an Excel sheet, and then sends an email notification.
Control-M orchestrates this entire process, ensuring smooth execution
